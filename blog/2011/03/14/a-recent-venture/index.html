	<h1 class="title">A Recent Venture.</h1>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>A month or two back a friend of mine came to me to show me a prototype web application he wrote for a project. The project was actually to create a prototype front end for a &#8220;Way-finding&#8221; system for an old folks home near his school. He showed me what he built, which was actually quite impressive and professional looking, but I was sad to see this direction system had not started to be built at all. I sat back realizing we had <em>just</em> recently learned about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">Dijkstra&#8217;s algorithm</a>. That was all fine and dandy that we learned how to, using graphs, find the fastest way from point A to B, but I was really interested in finding out how that would apply to maps, which would require more information in a database and so forth. Yes I know what you&#8217;re thinking &#8220;why not just use Google Maps API.&#8221; Well, yes I thought of that too, but this company wanted someone design their own map system because it was for navigating their business&#8217;s campus rather than navigating a street. This just got more interesting, because we&#8217;d really have a product to sell if we created a web application in which people can design their own Google Maps-esque page with their own set of maps for whatever they&#8217;d like to use it on.</p>

<p>With all of my running projects, school and an actual job the whole thing slipped my mind and I thought that was the end of it. A few weeks later, though, I received a call from the very same friend because that company called him saying they were so impressed they were thinking of drawing up a contract with him instead of a company that was hoping for nearly 5 times more than a college student would bid on this contract. This was great news since he asked me to build much of the back-end ( sooo I&#8217;m building the whole thing? ), sadly the project really was worth at least twice as much as we bid on it, but it could still be a great opportunity. Then he told me they wanted it 3 months after the contract was settled on&#8230; I was very close to driving over and throwing something at him, but I tried to calmly express that a 3 month ground-up project was possible suicide. Convinced, he put his bid down with 4 months (still short, but okay whatever). Thus I began freaking out because if we did get the contract then even with 4 months it would be a full load of homework, a 20 hour per week Linux admin job plus this project and a girlfriend. I&#8217;m screwed.</p>

<p>Pressed for time every day I began researching what tools I&#8217;d like to use. After some deliberation ( I would&#8217;ve spent more time on it but I was getting worried about this thing we call &#8216;time&#8217; ) I decided to use <a href="http://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a> for my back-end framework. I mostly decided on Cake because of the quick/easy experience I had when running a few personal tests and tinkering - plop in their source, start naming tables, fields, controllers, etc. correctly then everything starts working like an object&#8230; yay quick development! Excited to have found a quick framework I started thinking about revision control, because I don&#8217;t trust myself enough to not use revision control. Easily landed on <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> because I&#8217;ve familiarized myself with it over the year or two I&#8217;ve used it and I know what I&#8217;m doing for the most part. Quickly realized that I will actually want a workflow and some collaboration with my friend so I set up 3 subdomains for development, testing, and near-production. The testing domain would actually serve as the main holder for the workflow and dev would hold the really sketchy, maybe-gonna-work stuff. Within the testing domain I had a few different branches, because like I said, it would be the main holder for the application below production level. It contained a master (newest development seemingly stable stuff), a next (newest of new, might work), a test branch (beta-y, prepping for release) and finally a maintenance branch (flash bach to old tags and patch). One of the last things on my pre-development list was to set up a bug tracker for tracking new idea ventures, bugs (seriously, I know) and just keeping track of the project as a whole. I rarely like bug trackers, but <a href="http://www.redmine.org/">Redmine</a> is quite nice in my opinion, keeps track of commits, will &#8220;fix&#8221; bugs in the track if you comment on your commits correctly, just a clean tool to use overall. Finally I&#8217;m actually getting excited because things are starting to look like a real development project and my buddy calls to tell me that the company we were working with went with a product that will provide support.</p>

<p>Ouch.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m in the mixed feelings stage. I went from being worried as hell to being damn excited about the project. Now that its gone from my grasp (as if I had it ever?) I&#8217;m happy that I won&#8217;t lose hours of sleep, fail some class I hardly need or miss an hourly paying job I enjoy, but that excitement left me just as fast as it came. My current thoughts lie with whether or not continue and just make it a general product I could sell. Its all ready to be developed and now I might actually have some time to sit on the thing and do it right, but now that there isn&#8217;t a deadline its hard to make myself as excited as I was. Ya know? More on this decision as it becomes clear to me.</p>
