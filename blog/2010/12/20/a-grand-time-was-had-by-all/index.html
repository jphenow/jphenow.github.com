	<h2 class="title">A Grand Time Was Had by All</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>Time is slipping away from us as we can see the end near.</p>

<p>The Ireland group spent an afternoon down by the soccer fields playing some intense wet-ground football. We had a fantastic Thanksgiving meal and night in the pub with those at Park Lodge who make this all possible. We even had our bus driver and one of our professors join us for dinner, a talent show of the students, and some pints at the pub.</p>

<p>The weekend before our last week many of us spend the entire time in Galway at pubs, shopping, walking, and just remembering. We had some great nights hanging out with each other and sharing stories from what seems like so long ago and yet not long ago at all.</p>

<p>Everyone spent time preparing for final exams and essays.</p>

<p>In Theology we talked about Christmas tradition for some time then we sat around in the pub singing familiar Christmas carols to each other - we&#8217;ll miss you Mary Clancy. She never talked long enough about one thing for us to learn anything, the class structure was not there, and we still don&#8217;t know what you were trying to teach us, but you were the sweetest Irishwoman we know and we won&#8217;t forget your kindness and love for Johnnies and Bennies.</p>

<p>Our final day in History was spent praying we could pass the large exam. Laurence Marley, the man who knows it all about all things historical or otherwise. The man with a plan and a story for everything. Easily one of the most impressive professors I&#8217;ve ever had the pleasure to learn from.</p>

<p>Gerard O&#8217;Brien, the Irish James Bond of Literature. The suavest, and coolest man you&#8217;ve ever hoped to share a brandy with. Another class we&#8217;re not sure what we learned about, but we loved to hear you reminisce about Irish poetry and non-sensical writings of Joyce or some other great classic writer.</p>

<p>Our directors Elizabeth Stoltz and Dave All-that-is-man Hutcheson taught us that you don&#8217;t have to know what&#8217;s going on or how much money you have to run a study abroad program. They were like grandparents to us all and though we all may have different problems with them, they were some of the most caring and generous people we could have had the pleasure to be our directors. Elizabeth Stoltz&#8217;s Guiness cake and Dave Hutcheson&#8217;s run will always be memories I hold close to my heart.</p>

<p>Finally JP, the man who can &#8220;fix&#8221; anything as long as it involves liquor or a pint. We&#8217;ll miss the man who took care of us through many nights and had a watchful eye like a good uncle and close friend.</p>

<p>Our final night we had a large bonfire on the rocks, thanks to Evan Howard who decided to rebuild a 10-year-old pit built by Johnnies of old. Whiskey, beer, and stories were shared with some attempts at singing. We proceeded to a final night in High Hughes&#8217; in Spiddal, one last drunchie stop at Super Mac&#8217;s and back to the Park Lodge. We were allowed by JP to crash the last Irish wedding before people started to head home. We danced, we drank, we picked Nate up off the floor.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t sleep that night as I packed showered and remembered the first day I walked into the cottage. Its hard to believe it ended, but life goes on and there will be more memories to be had throughout life. I&#8217;ll miss the nights we had and look forward to meeting up with life long friends made throughout the time I had in Ireland.</p>

<p>Indeed, a grand time was had by all.</p>

<p>Cottage 5 (and 6 I spose) for life. Many a reunion will be had.</p>
