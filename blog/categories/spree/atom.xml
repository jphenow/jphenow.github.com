    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://refinerycms.com/">RefineryCMS</a>
is a great boilerplate for creating a CMS in Rails.
It basically gives you all the structure you need to build a custom CMS,
with lots of features built in and extensions to add.
<a href="http://spreecommerce.com/">Spree</a> offers similar
benefits but directed at being a shopping cart web application. I wanted to use
both of these tools in tandem.</p>

<p>I tried a number of things in an attempt to mix the two together in one unifying
application. Finally I stumbled across
<a href="https://github.com/adrianmacneil/spree-refinery-authentication">spree-refinery-authentication</a>.
This gem not only explains how to put the two things under one application, but
gives you the ability to have both authentication systems work together.</p>

<p>To get this basic merge, I literally just followed the steps on spree-refiner-authentication
README and I was off. I still have some work to do to make the two cooperate seemlessly
for an end-user, but more posts to come as I'm able to work through this.</p>
