    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I did it! I've made the switch! Loving it so far. This framework is so much easier for someone who is used to ssh, git, and vim. I feel like I can dig into the guts more easily. Not that you couldn't dig into the Wordpress guts but it usually made me feeling like I was trying to work on Audi when all of my mechanic experience was with Ford. Wordpress, coming from an understanding of MVC patterns, feels poorly built (hacked together really).</p>

<p>Quickly, now, lets talk conversion. I switched from Wordpress and of course, being a CS major, I can't manually copy things to the new blog. That's silly to me. So what I did was make a quick little Ruby script!</p>

<p>This is a terribly simple and hacked up script that will pull in all of your Wordpress posts (Granted you change the parameters for the MySQL connection). All you have to do, upon changing those parameters, is run <code>ruby wp_conv.rb</code> from the octopress directory. After that I would go through the <code>_posts</code> and be sure everything popped out correctly. I noticed that there are two main things to do to fix this script up - I didn't add support for grabbing categories or tags and it will grab each revision of your Wordpress posts. So here's what I did after running this script:</p>

<ul>
<li>Delete older revisions of posts that were downloaded</li>
<li>Add <code>categories</code> to YAML at top of each post</li>
<li>There's an odd issue with UTF-8 conversion

<ul>
<li>My Vim highlighted the weird spaces, but I had to go through and delete odd-looking characters</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>If you don't tend to that UTF-8 issue running <code>rake generate</code> will fail. I didn't experience this for all posts, but it definitely threw me off, so I apologize about that about the script, but I will see if there's a more sound way to handle that via the script.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: It's your own fault for running this script if something goes wrong, don't be upset with me, this was a hacked together script for some personal convenience and I figured I 'd share.</p>

<p>Happy hacking</p>

    <id>http://jphenow.com/blog/2011/08/16/first-octopost</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not even an hour of 'work' and I'm already delighted to be working with <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>! I'm in love with the automatic support for <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, the built in plugins for <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>. Those are the just the front-facing sprinkles though!</p>

<p>Octopress seems wonderfully prepared to be auto-deployed using some simple <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/githooks.html">Git-Hooks</a>. Currently I'm just editting the live version of the site, <em>don't kill me</em>, but once I get the site more settled to my tastes I will publish my setup for hooking git commits. I will likely base my git workflow of <a href="http://joemaller.com/990/a-web-focused-git-workflow/">this</a> as it seemed simple enough for this blog - I'd rather not over-complicate something that shouldn't be complex at all!</p>

<p>Lastly I was hoping to create a script for migrating old posts from WordPress to a set of posts that would work for Octpress. First I'd do the basic grab and insert to files, then I will look into allowing options for having default share or comment properties. Will you guys let me know if you're interested? Or even if this already exists!</p>

<p>Well I already cut into some sleeping time to tinker with this, so I will continue my tinkering and tweaking another time. Check back for updates on migration scripts and hook scripts!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Translation: I'm switching blogging frameworks in the coming weeks out of pure interest and to feed my adventurous nature.</p>

<p>For anyone that knows me personally I like to hop around projects, try new projects and really just explore the playing field. Not to toot my own horn, but I'm actually really good at switching gears like that. So pretty soon you may see me using a blog framework called <a href="http://octopress.org/" title="Octopress" target="_blank">Octopress</a>. Like I said, this is mostly out of interest in new things. Also, it uses Ruby and that happens to be the language I'll be familiarizing myself with for a new project! More on that later.</p>

<p>Do not fret! I have no bad blood for Wordpress (mostly), I'm not moving because Wordpress is getting terrible or anything. There are plenty of things that are good/bad about Wordpress IMHO, but one could say that about a lot of blogging web applications. For now you'll see the old site laying around and eventually you may see some new stuff popping up - I'll be prepping it on another domain or subdomain for now to keep interruption to my current site at minimum.</p>

<p>Another short note: it seems like I say this a lot, but I should be more and more available as my Summer internship wraps up. There should be an interesting article surfacing on that soon too.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Working on transitioning the blog! Hoping to work on a a better way of  doing this so I might do some crazy magic here pretty soon. I’d like to  move to a NoSQL method, but my current host isn’t a fan of allowing me  to run what I’d prefer at a reasonable price! Lots to do if this goes  through so, I know…. I’m not a <em>huge</em> fan of the current look, but we’ll see what I can work in to make this look decent before I hope to move.</p>
