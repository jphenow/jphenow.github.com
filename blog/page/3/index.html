			Southern Ireland</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>September 15th: wake up, finish packing, hit the road by 10am. We stuffed in our new home for the next four days, a stuffy Lally&#8217;s Tour bus, and drove for an hour or so to stop at W. B. Yeats&#8217; old Cottage/Tower. We met Gerard O&#8217;Brien, our literature professor, at the Cottage/Tower; he told us some more about the old structure and read a poem and we headed to Coole Park. Coole Park is where the famous Lady Gregory lived for years. Here we checked out the lake, grounds, and autograph tree. We moved on and quickly came to the realization that it was 3pm and none of us have eaten so we found refuge at a SuperMac&#8217;s (the McDonald&#8217;s Equivalent of Ireland) and continued our trek to Cork. Once in Cork we toured the beautiful city and it&#8217;s university. Finally we got to our first hostel of the trip, which was again more packed and stuffy so many of us simply dropped our stuff off and went to find a pub and/or some food. In this town we found a pub called &#8220;The Franciscan Well,&#8221; which turned out to be a great microbrewery for us to hang out in that night. This pub also had us stumble upon 3 fellow Minnesotans! One guy recognized a Twins hat someone had on and we talked to them for some time, but, oddly, the conversation was coming to a close shortly after we found out two of them had close relatives on the Tommie football team. &#8220;Enough of this company,&#8221; I said. I didn&#8217;t actually say that but, their relatives are on the Tommie team, one of them a current stud on the team.</p>

<p>We moved on in the morning to Blarney Castle and did, indeed, kiss the Blarney stone. So yes I am much more eloquent at this point, can you tell? Later, we stopped on the side of the road to have a look at the Michael Collins Memorial, where he was assassinated, and one of our directors gave us the full story. To this day, you can see many passers-by making the sign of the cross as they continue driving. We traveled a little further to stop at Muckross Castle and have a look around. We finally stopped in Killarney and dropped our stuff in a new hostel and went to find groceries that we could cook in the community kitchen of the hostel. Off we go again into town, since its someone&#8217;s birthday, and we found a few great pubs to hang out in. Met a man from Wisconsin this time, who was probably 7 feet tall.</p>

<p>This next day we spent at Muckross house and driving for several hours around the Ring of Kerry, which is just a pretty peninsula with lots of cliffs and great views of the ocean. We saw the island that is the closest European point to the US. That was mostly a long day in a bus, but we eventually returned to our same hostel as the previous night and had a more relaxed night in the pubs; we actually found an old fashioned Irish storyteller, who was the most vulgar person I&#8217;ve ever met in my life.</p>

<p>This day was much easier. We had a short drive to Tralee where we checked out the Kerry County Museum then drove through the Dingle Peninsula for a few hours, which was similar to the sights seen in the Ring of Kerry. We landed again in Tralee and, again, dropped our stuff and went searching for groceries to cook in the community kitchen. Found a few more pubs and had a quiet night.</p>

<p>The final day had arrived of our exhausting trip and we were all ready for a break. We hopped on the bus and went to the Cliffs of Moher for a few hours. We ate, looked at the exhibit and walked around the &#8220;regular&#8221; parts of the cliffs, which were all covered with big stone fences, stopping you from getting with 20ft of the edge. Well if you went all the way to the left end of the fences there was an interesting sight; first there was a memorial for &#8220;those lost at the cliffs&#8221;, then there was a &#8220;DANGER DO NOT GO BEYOND THIS POINT&#8221; sign, next there was sign saying how windy and dangerous the cliffs were, finally you could see all the people who disregarded all of these signs and warnings of death. Well we, being the smart deliberators we all are, followed suit and walked past these signs to get the real views of the cliffs. We took some silly pictures of us pretending to fall and be more scared than we were, in reality and we quickly scurried back to safety. I encourage you to look at <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/j.phenow/Galway10#">http://picasaweb.google.com/j.phenow/Galway10#</a> so you can see the fun pictures. There are probably some other good ones taken by others on Facebook. We ended our day with a stop in Galway for some weekly groceries and rest.</p>

<p>An interesting few days, indeed. Hope all is well with everyone at home, see you guys in a few months! Its coming up fast!</p>

			Cottage Life</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>You&#8217;d be surprised how busy we keep ourselves with cottage life. Lets start out with a look at a regular week that has no special occurrences, which is actually almost more irregular than a &#8220;regular&#8221; week since something is always going on. Anyways I start out my Monday waking up late, making breakfast checking emails, then I have a a class at 2pm which lasts until 5pm with the sweetest, but probably the worst Theology professor I&#8217;ve ever had the pleasure of listening to. Mary means well, but the only two redeeming factors of lectures is that she&#8217;s sweet and has an Irish accent. After our three hour torture session we return to the cottages and maybe start some homework, check out the coast, and relax. At some point in the night our cottage cook Jake will start making some meal I wouldn&#8217;t dare make, we all enjoy our meals, then start looking for activities for the night. Night activities include: mini cottage parties, reading, walking to the Spiddal pubs to listen to some Irish pickup music and have a pint or several, going to the Lodge bar to hang out with JP (coolest Irishmen yet), or just setting up a movie in the Lodge lounge. Tuesdays are quite similar but History starts at 10am and runs until 1pm then we have an Ethics class shortly thereafter. Our History professor is fantastic. I wouldn&#8217;t describe him as amazingly exciting, but he relates his growing up in Belfast to what we&#8217;re learning about very well, he&#8217;s plain old interesting, and well articulated. This class will definitely be the most work, though. Our Ethics professor is the Professor from CSB/SJU travelling with us, and she is an interesting woman. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ll say about that class for now. Wednesday we just have a 10am to 1pm class with the most fantastic Irish Literature professor one could ask for. He encompasses all that is class and cool about Literature professors with an Irish accent. Finally, to end the week, we have an Ethics class on Thursday and Friday.</p>

<p>Now keep in mind the above doesn&#8217;t actually happen that often, there&#8217;s usually much more involved in our weeks. First of all there&#8217;s already been about 9 21st birthdays so that means that at least 9 of our nights have been cabs into Galway and rough early mornings. Also about every 2 or 3 weeks we go on large excursions starting on the Wednesday of a week. We leave on the Wednesday then spend 4 or 5 days travelling, seeing Ireland landmarks and historical sights, &#8220;sleeping&#8221; in hostels, and checking out the local pubs.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve also been getting creative with our activities. Some of the girls have been getting intramurals setup for us, some of the guys have been trying to pickup Hurling (great game), all kinds of stuff. I&#8217;ll write about the excursions we&#8217;ve had thus far next.</p>

<p>Hope all is well at home with everyone. Can&#8217;t wait to see you all!</p>

			2 Weeks of Learning Experience</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Heading to the airport is always surreal to me. I can never imagine myself in the place I&#8217;m going. On this trip imagining myself in Paris, or wherever we were going to land, was even more difficult and drawn out. I got there 4 hours early, as the airports suggest for getting through customs and all, so, naturally, I ended up sitting still in the airport for 3 hours after I got through customs. So I sat, made some phone calls, got some stuff done then we finally got on board for the 6 hour Icelandair flight (surprisingly short right?). We landed in Reykjavik, Iceland and really just bummed around the airport for 19 hours. Do you realize how many times stores, restaurants and bars in airports close when you&#8217;re there for 19 hours? I hate that I know that they open and close at least 3 times.</p>

<p>Elise, one of the people in our group, luckily knows a guy through some connections. We found our way to his hidden mansion and became worried as we had trouble getting in, and we sat there for half an hour wondering if our entire trip would be this problematic. His concierge (yes he&#8217;s a very rich frenchman) let us in his gigantic palace of a place to leave our larger luggage. We ended up desperately finding a hostel and we set out on the town, since we had the entire day to walk around and fight the urge to sleep. We walked around and happened to stumble upon the famous Shakespeare and Company bookstore, nestled behind a big tree, just across the river from the Notre Dame. This place was packed, in every sense of the word, with books and people delighted to hear fellow English speakers. The upstairs was riddled with people reading the proprietor&#8217;s not-for-sale books amongst the old beds, typewriters, and the old A. Schindler piano. Speaking of the piano, 3 different people came up and delighted us with around 2 hours of music. On the second day we found ourselves a nicer hostel, in a nicer part of town (less pickpocketing). Literally 5 minutes after entering the 2 hundred year old place we opened the windows 2 people rosined up the beau and played for an hour. Fantastic. Other than that we did the regular site seeing of Paris: the Eiffel tower, churches, the Louvre, all we could handle to walk to over the course of a few days. We learned a lot in Paris about finding ourselves some sleeping arrangements, making further travel plans, and about living in a small backpack. One of the things we learned is that its nearly impossible to simply jump on a train (as the EURail pass advertises) whilst in France in the month of August. We also learned that even one set of train rides to Barcelona and back still makes our EURail pass very worthwhile. Thank God. From that whole experience (there&#8217;s more to say but its hard to give it justice in words so talk to me in person in a few months) we caught some metros and trains all the way down to Barcelona (we&#8217;re getting good at this).</p>

<p>Barcelona was hot. Hotter than Paris, which by this time is saying a lot, because Paris was a lot hotter than it was supposed to be. We spent two days in the middle of town and walked to the famous Segrada Familia and the old Cathderal. Segrada Familia is the Cathedral that was started in the 1800s (I think) and is still being worked on, very beautiful, elaborate, modern cathedral. The second half of the days in Barcelona we moved to a Hostel down 10 feet off the beach. Therefore we spent 2 and a half days squeezed in a tight 7 person room, sitting on the beach talking to goofy Spaniards and sitting at Ryan&#8217;s pub talking to Scotts and Irish ironically. A great few days but we were happy to move on from the crazy Indians/Middle Easterns trying to heckle us into buying everything under the sun.</p>

<p>We ended up in Montepellier for the afternoon napping in the park and avoiding the homeless man who wanted us to ALSO kiss is rat while standing in the fountain..</p>

<p>Happily returned to Paris, which oddly felt like we were returning to a home. We went back to our nicer hostel for 2 nights. Spent part of a day gathering our luggage from Elise&#8217;s friend, Michelle (man). He was one of the nicest people I&#8217;ve ever met. 80 years old and looks barely 60. He&#8217;s seen it all, went to school in Minnesota, speaks at least 5 languages and loves to talk about it all. We prepared for leaving the next day and found out that Ryan Air booked us for the wrong day. Their booking had us in Ireland more than a day after we had to already be in the cottages. We acted quickly and found a train to Cherbourg, a ferry to Southern Ireland then we&#8217;d be hopping trains to Galway.</p>

<p>More regular trains to Northern France then, little did we and our new Canadian friend know, this ferry would be like a low quality cruise ship. We had a large room for seating, where we slept on the floor (bad bad bad), there was a floor of 4 restaurants, a piano bar, and another bar lounge. The piano bar featured a light-hearted Irishman who played the Entertainer (so happy), while the other bar had a man trying to be Michael Jackson, with backup dancers, and a blackjack table. We found stuff to do. As I said earlier, the sleep on the floor was absolutely horrible, I woke up every hour, at least, and stayed up by the time 6 rolled around. That was good though because I got to watch the sun rise over the ocean with no one else on the sun deck.</p>

<p>We happily found ourselves on Irish shores and the people were nothing short of (I never use this word) delightful. Its Minnesota Nice on crack. We caught a train to Dublin, tram to the next station, then a train to Galway. Once in Galway we looked like lost Americans again with the map out and one guy stopped to ask if we needed help finding a hostel and another stopped in his CAR to try and suggest a place as well. At the hostel we did settle on, we found ourselves with the first free internet we&#8217;ve ever found anywhere in Europe. So, naturally, we spent 2 to 3 hours trying to get friends and family caught up, while putting pictures in a safe place on the computer.</p>

<p>The next day we found ourselves meeting Geraldine, the spunky cook of the Park lodge. She fed us, what we thought, was everything she could find in the kitchen. Since we beat everyone else to the lodge Geraldine drove us into Spiddal and gave us some &#8220;insider&#8221; info on the town and dropped us off. We walked the beach and the rocks along the coast and walked back to the Lodge to find the rest of our classmates arrived. Later that night we met some great Irish, beer, Jameson, and Irish music in the 3 pubs in Spiddal.</p>

<p>There, you are all caught up to the best of my ability for now. There are more fun and detailed stories for those who see me in person! Miss you all and hope home hasn&#8217;t changed too much by the time December rolls through.</p>

			Ireland: In the Works</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I think eventually I&#8217;ll use this venue to post my crazy ideas about politics, life, and, my personal favorite, Technology. For now, though, let&#8217;s just use this as a medium for which I can convey to a number of people, my experiences in Ireland. I promise I won&#8217;t use this to brag too much about how great of an experience I expect I may have, but rather it is something I can use so that I don&#8217;t have to write a long email each day and possibly keep track of a number of things I don&#8217;t care to have to keep track of. So bookmark this page and keep an eye on my Facebook updates over the next coming months for minor updates. Once I&#8217;m over there I&#8217;ll do my best to give you all a show, and perhaps a smile.</p>

<p>Before I set this off as my first post for the blog that I&#8217;ll use for my Ireland trip, I think I&#8217;ll give some run down as to what my plans actually are, if they can even be called that. Three friends of mine, along with myself, have decided to spend two weeks catching trains and sleeping wherever we fall. This gives me two feelings, in my gut. The First:  &#8220;Finally I get to go out, be adventuresome, and explore lands unseen (to me), what a great time there is to be had by all.&#8221; The Second: &#8220;Oh sh*t I&#8217;m going to die, get lost and get eaten by the absurd Europeans.&#8221; Well, no I&#8217;m not actually that worried about the second one, but I really am starting to get a mix of emotions here, people. A few months ago we picked up our tickets to Paris. Luckily for us: one of our friends knows someone in paris who will allow us to leave our larger luggage at her apartment while we travel. We also decided to pick up a 15-day Euro-Rail pass. And so it was decided: kick-off August 18th and travel until about September 2nd, just in time for us to get to Ireland for class. Later on in this whole series of planning and buying, one of us finally realized what our flight to Europe looked like. When we were searching, the only thing on our mind was &#8220;lets get it as cheap as possible&#8221; and I&#8217;ll be honest we&#8217;re still glad we did that. We did notice, however, while looking at the ticket a touch more closely, that we leave the evening of the 18th, land in Reykjavik at about 6:30AM, then don&#8217;t fly out again until about 1AM!! So we have a long lay-over ahead of us but hey, at least we&#8217;ll be on our way. All we have left to do is pick up some rail passes and we&#8217;re all set to go.</p>

<p>I look forward to even this part of my trip (writing to you all) as I believe it will help any home-sickness, while I pretend to be talking to you all from home, thinking of what about my trip you&#8217;d enjoy hearing.</p>
