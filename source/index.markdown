#### Octopress!?

In my exploration of [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) I've come across this great blogging framework and begun to embrace it. Finally I found a blogging framework that allows for easy changes and deployment for people who are used to using [git](http://git-scm.com/) and [VIm](http://www.vim.org).

#### A little about me

I’m a Computer Science student at Saint John’s University in Collegeville, Minnesota (yes, that’s the real name of the town). I spend my days going to class, enjoying my time at school with my fellow Johnnies and simply trying to enjoy life for what it is. At school I work as an IT Linux Administrative Assistant and love it. My boss has taught me a lot about being an independent worker and person – while teaching me a lot about things like Open Source and what it takes to run a small fleet of Linux boxes.

In recent years I have become a big advocate for Open Source and a Linux fanatic. I try my best to keep up on the current cutting-edge of technology and the politics that surround them. My main focus right now, though, is to build and Open Source one of my own projects.
