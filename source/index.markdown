#### Hello

I'm a Nerd with a Computer Science degree. I make a living developing cool,
interesting technology. Primarily I build things for the web with Ruby/Ruby on Rails, but
I love to hop around technologies and languages. I'm consistently seeking to learn more and
create things intelligently. Sometimes, when I find some time, I try to share my thoughts and
experience here.

Contact me at j.phenow[at]gmail[dot]com or one of the links below for further information.
