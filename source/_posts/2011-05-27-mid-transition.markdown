Working on transitioning the blog! Hoping to work on a a better way of  doing this so I might do some crazy magic here pretty soon. I’d like to  move to a NoSQL method, but my current host isn’t a fan of allowing me  to run what I’d prefer at a reasonable price! Lots to do if this goes  through so, I know…. I’m not a <em>huge</em> fan of the current look, but we’ll see what I can work in to make this look decent before I hope to move.
