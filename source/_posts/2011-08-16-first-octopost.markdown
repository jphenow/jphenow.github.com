Not even an hour of 'work' and I'm already delighted to be working with [Octopress](http://octopress.org/)! I'm in love with the automatic support for [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), the built in plugins for [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com). Those are the just the front-facing sprinkles though!

Octopress seems wonderfully prepared to be auto-deployed using some simple [Git-Hooks](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/githooks.html). Currently I'm just editting the live version of the site, _don't kill me_, but once I get the site more settled to my tastes I will publish my setup for hooking git commits. I will likely base my git workflow of [this](http://joemaller.com/990/a-web-focused-git-workflow/) as it seemed simple enough for this blog - I'd rather not over-complicate something that shouldn't be complex at all!

Lastly I was hoping to create a script for migrating old posts from WordPress to a set of posts that would work for Octpress. First I'd do the basic grab and insert to files, then I will look into allowing options for having default share or comment properties. Will you guys let me know if you're interested? Or even if this already exists!

Well I already cut into some sleeping time to tinker with this, so I will continue my tinkering and tweaking another time. Check back for updates on migration scripts and hook scripts!
