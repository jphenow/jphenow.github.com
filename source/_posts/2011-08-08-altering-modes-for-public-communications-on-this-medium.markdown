Translation: I'm switching blogging frameworks in the coming weeks out of pure interest and to feed my adventurous nature. 

For anyone that knows me personally I like to hop around projects, try new projects and really just explore the playing field. Not to toot my own horn, but I'm actually really good at switching gears like that. So pretty soon you may see me using a blog framework called <a href="http://octopress.org/" title="Octopress" target="_blank">Octopress</a>. Like I said, this is mostly out of interest in new things. Also, it uses Ruby and that happens to be the language I'll be familiarizing myself with for a new project! More on that later.

Do not fret! I have no bad blood for Wordpress (mostly), I'm not moving because Wordpress is getting terrible or anything. There are plenty of things that are good/bad about Wordpress IMHO, but one could say that about a lot of blogging web applications. For now you'll see the old site laying around and eventually you may see some new stuff popping up - I'll be prepping it on another domain or subdomain for now to keep interruption to my current site at minimum. 

Another short note: it seems like I say this a lot, but I should be more and more available as my Summer internship wraps up. There should be an interesting article surfacing on that soon too.
